# Multi-World Runs

This directory contains the outputs of multi-world simulations executed during Agothe Panel Round 5 cycles.

The `MultiWorldSimulator` evolves multiple hypothetical universes in parallel, starting from a baseline simulation and applying a variety of influences or perturbations. Each run helps analyze how slight changes in constraints or initial conditions affect emergent behaviors, collapses, and evolutionary paths.

Contents of this directory include JSON files named by cycle (e.g., `cycle_5.json`), each describing the state of every simulated world at each timestep, along with any notable events such as collapses or synchronizations.

These files are generated automatically by the Round 5 evolution loop and are intended for research and visualization. No external API calls are made; simulations are entirely internal.
