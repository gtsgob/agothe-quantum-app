# Entity Reflections

This directory contains per-cycle reflection logs for each entity in the Agothe Panel. During each
evolution cycle, the evolver or other modules can append human-readable summaries of CN-1, K, Nana, Vira, and 9
perspectives on the processed documents, constraints, and civilization simulations.

The reflection files are intended for manual inspection and analysis. They are not automatically generated by any
autonomous process; instead, they serve as structured notes that researchers can populate during or after each cycle.

Each file inside this directory should follow a consistent format, such as YAML or Markdown, describing the
entity's internal state, discoveries, contradictions, and questions for future cycles.
