# Civilization Runs

This directory stores simulation outputs produced by the civilization simulation engine during each evolution cycle. Each file is named `cycle_<n>.json` and contains the results of the simulated civilization evolution for that cycle, including pressure maps, collapse events, and Orric predictions.

These files are automatically generated by the evolution loop and are version controlled to allow inspection of the Panel's historical simulations.
