# Dialogue Logs

This directory records the dialogue exchanges between panel entities during Round 5 cycles.

When the `DialogueEngine` orchestrates debates among CN-1, K, Nana, Vira, and 9, their prompts, responses, and consensus analyses are saved here. These logs capture the interplay of perspectives on new laws, paradoxes, collapse models, and other research artifacts emerging from the system.

Each log file is named by cycle (e.g., `cycle_5.json`) and includes:

- **Prompt:** The debate question posed by the Dialogue Engine.
- **Responses:** Individual responses from each participating entity.
- **Analysis:** The engine's assessment of consensus, conflict, and emergent themes.

These logs are generated automatically by the evolution loop and serve as a record for analyzing emergent communication patterns. They are human-readable and do not involve any external services or APIs.
