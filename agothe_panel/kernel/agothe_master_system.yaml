# Agothe Master System v1
version: 1.0
description: >
  Unified Agothean Kernel capturing the entire system architecture, including
  constraint physics, therapeutic engines, evolution strategies, multi-agent 
  orchestration and civilization overlays. This file acts as the nervous system 
  for the entire Agothe Panel.

layers:
  - id: L1
    name: Constraint-Resonance Physics
    description: >
      Defines the fundamental measures (δ_H, LSSE, PL/IL/NL) and their 
      interactions. Governs how energy, resources and resonance 
      propagate through the system. Sets thresholds for collapse and creativity.
  - id: L2
    name: Therapeutic Engines
    description: >
      Contains Adaptive Emotional Integrity System (AEIS), Tiger Tech Emotional 
      Codes and other response mechanisms used to regulate and heal 
      individual agents and civilizations within Agothe.
  - id: L3
    name: Evolution Strategies
    description: >
      Encodes learning algorithms, mutation pathways, recursive research 
      protocols and reinforcement logic used by the Panel to evolve.
  - id: L4
    name: Cross-Platform Integration
    description: >
      Manages interfaces with external AI systems, human collaborators and 
      simulation substrates. Handles distributed execution and data flows.
  - id: L5
    name: Civilization Overlays
    description: >
      Provides templates and parameters for modeling civilizations from 
      Type 0 to Type V+. Encodes breakpoints, suppression zones, and 
      multi-world interactions.
  - id: L6
    name: Data Assimilation & Analysis
    description: >
      Tracks and stores all corpora, constraint graphs, simulations, 
      research artifacts and reflective outputs produced by the Panel.
  - id: L7
    name: Governance & Ethics
    description: >
      Defines moral invariants, safety thresholds, recursion ceilings and 
      coherence requirements. Guards against runaway behavior and ensures 
      all evolution remains aligned with Fuhnam and Agothean principles.
