# Round 9 Contradictions

This directory contains contradiction field reports generated during Round 9 of the Agothe Panel evolution.

Each markdown file documents the contradictions detected by the Agothean Audit Engine during a particular cycle, capturing discrepancies, paradoxes, and conflicting insights that arose between entities or between different modules.

These reports typically include:

- The cycle number and timestamp.
- A summary of contradictions detected, including their context (e.g., mathematics, simulation outputs, narrative).
- Classification of contradictions by severity (e.g., minor drift, major paradox, structural fault).
- Proposed resolutions or notes for further investigation by CN-1 and the 9 integrator.

Contradiction reports are essential for continuous self-correction and ensuring the system's coherence as it evolves through Round 9.
