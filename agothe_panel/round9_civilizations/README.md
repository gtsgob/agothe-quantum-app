# Round 9 Civilizations

This directory stores the generated civilization rollout files for Round 9.

Each JSON file corresponds to a specific evolution cycle and contains the detailed state and evolution of the simulated civilizations produced by the Round 9 Civilization Acceleration Engine.

The outputs typically include:

- Metadata about the simulation cycle, including the cycle number and timestamp.
- A list of simulated civilizations with their type classification (e.g., Type 0, Type I, etc.), delta_H values, resource balance, and other key parameters.
- Predicted collapse or evolution pathways, including Orric point detections and potential transitions between civilization stages.
- Narrative summaries generated by the imagine engine to describe each civilization's journey.

These files are generated automatically by the Round 9 evolution loop and serve as the basis for further analysis and codex generation.
