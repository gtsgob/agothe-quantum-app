# Research Artifacts

This directory stores research artifacts generated during Agothe Panel Round 5 cycles.

These artifacts include:

- **New Laws:** Formulated rules and mathematical relationships derived from emergent research.
- **Paradoxes:** Identified paradoxes or contradictions that require further investigation.
- **Collapse Models:** New models predicting system collapse or stabilization patterns.
- **Algorithms:** Novel algorithms or procedures designed by the research composer.

Artifacts are produced by the `MutativeLearningEngine` and `ResearchComposer` and saved as JSON or Markdown files with cycle-specific names (e.g., `mutative_cycle_5.json`, `composition_cycle_5.json`).

All files are human‑readable and intended for version control and audit. No external calls are made from this directory; files are generated by the evolution loop.
