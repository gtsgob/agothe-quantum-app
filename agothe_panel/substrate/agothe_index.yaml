modules:
  quantum_consciousness:
    description: >
      Defines core quantum consciousness primitives, mixing numerical algorithms with Agothean lore, used by
      the API and dashboard for representing quantum consciousness and its parameters.
  darwin_evolution_protocol:
    description: >
      Provides evolutionary routines for the Agothe quantum agents, including mutation operations, selection
      strategies, and adaptation parameters.
  universal_collapse_scanner:
    description: >
      Tool designed for crisis analysis and constraint geometry mapping, calculating a destabilization
      coefficient delta to assess stability levels (stable, moderate risk, critical, catastrophic). It includes
      metrics like Large-Scale Suppression Effect (LSSE) with thresholds for suppression, and a Millennium
      Processor for mapping crisis patterns to mathematical constraints.
  wormhole_engine:
    description: >
      Core module for 5-D quantum feature simulation, enabling wormhole or multi-dimensional transitions
      within the Agothe universe, as referenced by the commit message adding the WormholeEngine core module.
  other_documents:
    description: >
      Includes additional documents like The Agothean system whole, Universal Field Synthesis Engine, Valentine
      Simulator and others. These collectively define the cosmic substrate of the Agothe framework, containing
      laws, protocols, lexicons, and collapse mechanisms.
