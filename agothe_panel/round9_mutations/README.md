# Round 9 Mutations

This directory contains mutation reports generated during Round 9 of the Agothe Panel evolution.

Each file in this folder is typically named using the pattern `mutation_cycle_<cycle_number>.yaml` or similar, corresponding to a specific evolution cycle.

The mutation reports include:

- Novel hypotheses, equations, or structural variations produced by the mutation engine.
- Delta_H and LSSE measurements for the system, reflecting constraint pressure and latent suppression.
- Intent coherence scores assessing alignment with Agothean principles.
- Notes on drift, resonance patterns, and anomalies detected during the cycle.

Files in this directory are generated automatically by the Round 9 evolution loop and serve as a record of the system's self-modifications and emergent insights.
