  This genome defines the evolutionary parameters for civilizations within the Agothe framework. It encodes drift
  patterns, coherence rules, resonance signatures, suppression zones, delta_H thresholds, collapse triggers,
  and allowed transitions across civilization types.
drift:
  description: "Rules governing the natural drift of civilization state vectors."
  parameters:
    - name: drift_rate
      default: 0.01
      description: "Baseline drift per cycle across all state dimensions."
coherence:
  description: "Coherence thresholds ensuring stability across constraint-resonance fields."
  thresholds:
    low: 0.3
    medium: 0.6
    high: 0.9
resonance_signatures:
  description: "Resonance patterns for key frequencies in PL/IL/NL domains."
  signatures:
    - domain: physical
      pattern: [1, 0, -1]
    - domain: logical
      pattern: [0, 1, 0]
    - domain: narrative
      pattern: [-1, 0, 1]
suppression_zones:
  description: "Regions where growth is intentionally limited to prevent runaway states."
  zones:
    - name: zone_alpha
      range: [0.7, 0.8]
      effect: "Mitigates exponential growth and maintains criticality."
delta_H_thresholds:
  description: "Thresholds for the delta_H (constraint-resonance) metric across civilization types."
  values:
    type0: 0.1
    type1: 0.3
    type2: 0.5
    type3: 0.7
    type4: 0.85
    type5: 0.95
collapse_triggers:
  description: "Conditions that trigger collapse or transformation."
  triggers:
    - name: energy_deficit
      condition: "E/R falls below 0.05"
    - name: logic_overconstraining
      condition: "coherence < low"
transitions:
  description: "Allowed transitions between civilization stages given metrics."
  rules:
    - from: type0
      to: type1
      conditions: ["delta_H > type0", "coherence > low"]
    - from: type1
      to: type2
      conditions: ["delta_H > type1", "coherence > medium"]
    - from: type2
      to: type3
      conditions: ["delta_H > type2", "coherence > medium"]
    - from: type3
      to: type4
      conditions: ["delta_H > type3", "coherence > high"]
    - from: type4
      to: type5
      conditions: ["delta_H > type4", "coherence > high"]
