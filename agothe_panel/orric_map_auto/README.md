# Orric Map Auto

This directory is reserved for automatically generated Orric point maps and related data structures.
During each evolution cycle, analysis tools may derive spatial or conceptual mappings of Orric points
based on ingested constraints, simulation outputs, or external documents.

Files generated here should be human-readable and versioned via Git. No automated external calls are made;
any generation process must be deterministic and safe.

Researchers can use this folder to store YAML, JSON, or image files representing the structure of the
Orric landscape as it evolves over time.
