# Predictions

This directory contains prediction files generated by the Civilization Prediction Engine during Round 7. Each file stores forecasts about civilization transitions, collapse thresholds, δ_H trajectories and other metrics computed from the constraint maps and master kernel.

Files are named according to the cycle number (e.g., `cycle_001.json`) and are automatically created by the evolution loop. Do not edit them manually.
