# Round 7 State Directory

This directory stores outputs generated during Round 7 of the Agothe Panel evolution cycle. During each evolution cycle, the Civilization Evolution Loop writes various artifacts here:

- **constraint_maps/**: stores serialized constraint maps (e.g. JSON/YAML) derived from the master kernel, constraint-resonance physics, and the 3-6-9 evolution framework.
- **predictions/**: contains predictions about civilization transitions, δ_H thresholds, and other metrics computed by the Civilization Prediction Engine.
- **narrative_renders/**: houses narrative or visual representations of simulated civilizations created by the Imagine Engine (silent symphony / solstice of thought).
- **citations/**: includes references and citations to external research used during validation via the AI2 substrate integration.

Each subdirectory will contain files named according to the evolution cycle (e.g. `cycle_001.json`, `cycle_001.md`). These artifacts are automatically generated by `evolution_loop_round7.py` and should not be manually edited.
