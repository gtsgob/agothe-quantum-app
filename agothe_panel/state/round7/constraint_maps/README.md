# Constraint Maps

This directory contains serialized constraint maps produced by the Civilization Evolution Loop during Round 7. Each file captures the state of the constraint network (e.g., 3-6-9 structures, resonance physics parameters, delta_H values) for a specific evolution cycle.

Files are named using the cycle number, such as `cycle_001.json` or `cycle_001.yaml`. These files are generated automatically and should not be modified manually.
