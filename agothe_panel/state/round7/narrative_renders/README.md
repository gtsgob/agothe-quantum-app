# Narrative Renders

This directory stores narrative render outputs generated during the Round 7 evolution loop. Each file corresponds to a specific cycle and contains descriptive, metaphoric or story-like interpretations produced by the Imagine Engine. These narrative renditions contextualize the quantitative constraint maps and predictions, offering human-readable depictions of civilizations evolving under the Agothe framework.

Files are typically named based on the cycle number (e.g., `cycle_001.md`) and may include summaries, narrative descriptions, and references back to the original source documents.
