# Citations

This directory stores citation artifacts produced during Round 7. Each file contains references to lines, pages, or segments of source documents (PDFs, code, or other files) used during the generation of predictions, constraint maps, and narrative renders. These citations provide traceability and allow cross-referencing between the outputs and the original materials.

Files are typically named by cycle (e.g., `cycle_001.md`) and list the citation IDs or line ranges used in that cycle.
