## Multi-Geometry Crises

Many crises exhibit multiple geometries simultaneously:

2. **Hodge**: Economic tipping point crossed
3. **Navier-Stokes**: Migration flow crisis
4. **Riemann**: Inequality explosion

## Using Geometry Routing

### Code Example

```python
from src.core.geometry_router import GeometryRouter

router = GeometryRouter()

# Define observed patterns
patterns = {
    'blockade': True,
    'displacement': True,
    'hidden_actors': True,
    'inequality': True
}

# Route to geometries
geometries = router.route(patterns)

for geometry in geometries:
    print(f"{geometry.name}: {router.describe_geometry(geometry)}")
```

### Output
```
YANG_MILLS: Confinement - Resources/people trapped
NAVIER_STOKES: Flow - Distribution/logistics breakdown
BSD_EXTENDED: Hidden Variables - Unseen forces driving crisis
RIEMANN: Gap - Inequality widening, fragmentation
```

## Analytical Value

### What Geometry Routing Provides

1. **Structural Insight**: Identifies underlying constraint patterns
2. **Analogy**: Connects to well-studied mathematical systems
3. **Prediction**: Suggests likely evolution based on geometry type
4. **Intervention**: Indicates leverage points based on constraint structure

### What It Doesn't Provide

1. **Quantitative Prediction**: Geometries are qualitative frameworks
2. **Causation**: Pattern matching doesn't prove causation
3. **Completeness**: Not all crises fit geometry categories

---

## Pattern Recognition Guide

### How to Identify Patterns

1. **Observe crisis dynamics** - What's actually happening?
2. **Identify constraints** - What forces shape the crisis?
3. **Match to patterns** - Which geometry patterns are present?
4. **Validate fit** - Does the geometry illuminate crisis structure?

### Common Pitfalls

- **Over-fitting**: Forcing geometries where they don't apply
- **Single-geometry bias**: Missing multi-geometry nature
- **Metaphor confusion**: Treating analogies as literal mechanisms

---

## Advanced Applications

### Geometry Combinations

Certain geometry pairs indicate specific crisis types:

**Yang-Mills + BSD Extended**
- Siege with hidden sponsorship
- Example: Yemen blockade

**Hodge + Quantum Tunneling**
- Tipping point + barrier crossing
- Example: Regime collapse moments

**Riemann + Navier-Stokes**
- Inequality + displacement
- Example: Climate migration

### Temporal Sequencing

Geometries can evolve:
1. **Hodge** (tipping point) →
2. **Quantum Tunneling** (barrier break) →
3. **Existence/Smoothness** (chaos) →
4. **Yang-Mills** (confinement)

Example: Syria (2011-2015)

---

## Research Applications

### Potential Studies

1. **Geometry frequency analysis**: Which geometries appear most often?
2. **Outcome correlation**: Do certain geometries predict outcomes?
3. **Intervention effectiveness**: Are some geometries more responsive?
4. **Early warning**: Can geometry shifts predict escalation?
