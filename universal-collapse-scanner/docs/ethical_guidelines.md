# Ethical Guidelines

## Responsible Use of Universal Collapse Scanner

The Universal Collapse Scanner provides powerful tools for measuring system collapse. With that power comes responsibility. This document outlines ethical principles for use.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Do No Harm

**Primary Obligation:** Never use this framework in ways that increase suffering.

**Prohibited Uses:**
- ❌ Optimizing suppression mechanisms
- ❌ Improving censorship effectiveness
- ❌ Targeting vulnerable populations
- ❌ Weaponizing crisis information

**Example:** Do NOT use LSSE to help actors suppress coverage more effectively.

---

### 2. Advocate for the Vulnerable

**Intended Purpose:** Use measurements to give voice to neglected crises.

**Encouraged Uses:**
- ✅ Humanitarian advocacy
- ✅ Media accountability
- ✅ Policy transparency
- ✅ Academic research

**Example:** Use δ scores to demonstrate urgency of under-resourced crises.

---

### 3. Transparency

**Requirement:** Be transparent about methodology, assumptions, and limitations.

**Best Practices:**
- Document data sources
- Acknowledge uncertainty
- Share methodology
- Explain scoring rationale
- Disclose potential biases

---

### 4. Respect Privacy

**Principle:** Aggregate data, don't surveil individuals.

**Guidelines:**
- Use population-level data
- Avoid identifying individuals
- Protect vulnerable sources
- Respect community consent

---

### 5. Cultural Humility

**Recognition:** Metrics don't capture full human experience.

**Practice:**
- Listen to affected communities
- Recognize metric limitations
- Avoid reducing crises to numbers
- Center lived experience

---

## Specific Use Cases

### PERMITTED: Humanitarian Advocacy

**Scenario:** NGO uses δ scores to demonstrate crisis severity to donors.

**Ethical Check:**
- ✅ Increases resources to crisis
- ✅ Transparent methodology
- ✅ Protects affected populations
- ✅ Amplifies marginalized voices

**Best Practice:** Share findings with affected communities first.

---

### PERMITTED: Academic Research

**Scenario:** Researcher analyzes LSSE patterns across conflicts to study media bias.

**Ethical Check:**
- ✅ Advances understanding
- ✅ Peer-reviewed methodology
- ✅ Publicly available findings
- ✅ No harm to subjects

**Best Practice:** Publish open-access to maximize benefit.

---

### PERMITTED: Policy Analysis

**Scenario:** Analyst uses framework to evaluate response effectiveness.

**Ethical Check:**
- ✅ Improves policy outcomes
- ✅ Evidence-based approach
- ✅ Accountable to public
- ✅ Serves public interest

**Best Practice:** Engage policymakers constructively, not punitively.

---

### PROHIBITED: Predictive Surveillance

**Scenario:** Government uses δ to predict and preempt dissent.

**Ethical Violation:**
- ❌ Enables repression
- ❌ Targets populations
- ❌ Violates privacy
- ❌ Causes harm

**Why Prohibited:** Framework measures collapse, not predicts individual behavior.

---

### PROHIBITED: Suppression Optimization

**Scenario:** Actor uses LSSE to improve crisis concealment.

**Ethical Violation:**
- ❌ Increases suffering
- ❌ Enables coverups
- ❌ Harms accountability
- ❌ Weaponizes information

**Why Prohibited:** Direct inversion of intended purpose.

---

### PROHIBITED: Market Exploitation

**Scenario:** Hedge fund uses crisis metrics to profit from suffering.

**Ethical Concern:**
- ⚠️ Extracts value from crisis
- ⚠️ No benefit to affected
- ⚠️ Potentially exploitative
- ⚠️ Moral hazard

**Guidance:** Questionable use. If pursuing, ensure proceeds benefit affected populations.

---

## Data Ethics

### Source Transparency

**Requirement:** Cite data sources explicitly.

**Standard Format:**
```
Delta Components:
- Severity: 0.85 (Source: UN OCHA Humanitarian Snapshot, 2024-01-15)
- Irreversibility: 0.75 (Source: WHO Health Assessment, 2024-01-10)
- Time Pressure: 0.90 (Source: Expert assessment, Dr. X, 2024-01-12)
- Response Capacity: 0.80 (Source: FTS funding data, 2024-01-14)
- Recovery Potential: 0.70 (Source: World Bank damage assessment, 2024-01-08)
```

---

### Uncertainty Communication

**Requirement:** Acknowledge limitations and uncertainty.

**Example:**
```
δ = 0.873 ± 0.12 (95% CI)

Limitations:
- Response capacity estimated due to access restrictions
- Deaths per day extrapolated from partial reporting
- Recovery potential based on comparable cases

Confidence: Moderate
```

---

### Data Minimization

**Principle:** Collect only necessary data.

**Practice:**
- Use aggregated statistics
- Avoid unnecessary granularity
- Delete sensitive details
- Minimize retention

---

## Publication Ethics

### Responsible Disclosure

**When publishing crisis analyses:**

1. **Assess Impact:** Could publication cause harm?
2. **Seek Consent:** Engage affected communities if possible
3. **Protect Identity:** Anonymize as needed
4. **Time Appropriately:** Consider timing sensitivity
5. **Provide Context:** Explain limitations clearly

---

### Attribution

**Requirement:** Credit data sources and affected communities.

**Example Attribution:**
```
Analysis based on:
- Data from: UN OCHA, WHO, ACLED
- Methodology: Universal Collapse Scanner v1.0
- Consultation: [Community organization name, if applicable]
- Published: [Date]

Dedicated to the people of [affected region].
```

---

## Conflict of Interest

### Disclosure Requirements

**Declare conflicts when:**
- Funded by interested parties
- Analyzing own organization
- Personal ties to actors
- Financial interests in outcomes

**Standard Disclosure:**
```
Funding: [Source]
Affiliations: [Organizations]
Potential Conflicts: [Description]
Mitigation: [How conflict is managed]
```

---

## Dual-Use Dilemma

### The Challenge

Crisis measurement tools can be used for good or harm.

### Our Approach

**Tier 1 (Public):** Educational framework, no weaponized components

**Not Included in Tier 1:**
- Real-time crisis feeds
- Automated suppression detection
- Elite network mapping
- Specific case adjacencies

**Why:** Reduces dual-use risk while enabling legitimate research.

---

## Community Engagement

### Best Practices

1. **Center Affected Voices:** Prioritize perspectives of those experiencing crisis
2. **Collaborative Analysis:** Work with local researchers when possible
3. **Capacity Building:** Share tools and training with local organizations
4. **Feedback Loops:** Create mechanisms for community input
5. **Benefit Sharing:** Ensure analyses benefit affected populations

---

## Red Lines

### Absolute Prohibitions

**Never use this framework to:**

1. **Target individuals for harm**
2. **Optimize repression mechanisms**
3. **Improve information suppression**
4. **Enable discrimination**
5. **Profit from suffering without benefit to affected**
6. **Violate privacy of vulnerable populations**
7. **Support human rights violations**
8. **Enable weapons targeting**
9. **Facilitate genocide or ethnic cleansing**
10. **Undermine humanitarian operations**

**If in doubt, don't proceed. Consult ethics review.**

---

## Accountability Mechanisms

### Self-Assessment Questions

Before using framework, ask:

1. **Purpose:** Why am I doing this analysis?
2. **Benefit:** Who benefits from this analysis?
3. **Harm:** Could this analysis cause harm?
4. **Consent:** Have I engaged affected communities?
5. **Transparency:** Am I being transparent about methods?
6. **Alternatives:** Are there less risky approaches?
7. **Oversight:** Is there appropriate review?

**If answers raise concerns, seek ethics consultation.**

---

### Ethics Review

**Recommended for:**
- Novel applications
- Sensitive crises
- Publication to large audiences
- Government/institutional use
- Potential dual-use scenarios

**Resources:**
- Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)
- Ethics committees
- Community advisory boards
- Professional associations

---

## Case Studies

### ✅ GOOD: Sudan Crisis Advocacy (2023)

**Use:** NGO coalition used δ scores to demonstrate crisis severity being overlooked.

**Outcome:**
- Increased media coverage
- More humanitarian funding
- Policy attention

**Why Ethical:**
- Served affected population
- Transparent methodology
- Increased resources
- Community-centered

---

### ❌ BAD: Hypothetical Suppression Analysis

**Use:** Government uses LSSE to identify and close coverage gaps.

**Outcome:**
- Improved crisis concealment
- Reduced accountability
- Increased suffering

**Why Unethical:**
- Inverted purpose
- Enabled harm
- Reduced transparency
- Weaponized information

---

### ⚠️ UNCERTAIN: Proprietary Crisis Consulting

**Use:** Private firm sells δ analyses to corporations.

**Considerations:**
- Who benefits?
- Is knowledge shared publicly?
- Does it help affected populations?
- Transparency maintained?

**Guidance:** Acceptable IF:
- Findings shared publicly
- Portion of proceeds supports humanitarian work
- No harm to affected populations
- Transparent methodology
